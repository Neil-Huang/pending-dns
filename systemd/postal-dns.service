# Example systemd unit file for Postal DNS

# Requires Node.js and Redis
# Installation instructions for Node.js:
#     https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
# Install Redis on Ubuntu:
#     https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-redis-on-ubuntu-18-04

# Copy this file to /etc/systemd/system/postal-dns.service

# Once set up (or service file is modified) run as root:
#     systemctl daemon-reload
#     systemctl enable postal-dns
#     systemctl restart postal-dns

[Unit]
Description=Postal DNS

# In some platforms redis could be installed as redis-server.service
# So make sure the service name listed here is valid
After=redis.service
# If redis is not installed into local machine
#After=network.target

[Service]
Environment="NODE_ENV=production"

# --- Configuration ---

# Optional. Uncomment to use a system specific configuration file outside of the Postal DNS folder.
# Configuration settings from this file are merged with default settings.
#Environment="NODE_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/postal-dns.toml"

# --- Application ---

# This is the folder where Postal DNS files reside.

# NB! If you are using `npx` to run the application then you can ignore this section
# and comment out `WorkingDirectory` as npx manages code files and dependencies itself.

# Normally this folder would include a clean copy from the Postal DNS Github repository + `npm install --production`.
# To set up:
#     git clone git://github.com/andris9/postal-dns.git
#     cd postal-dns
#     npm install --production

# If Postal DNS files are cloned from Github then an easy way to upgrade the application would look like this:
#    git pull origin master
#    npm install --production
# And then (as root or a user with sudo privileges):
#    sudo systemctl restart postal-dns

WorkingDirectory=/home/deployer/apps/postal-dns/

# --- Service user ---

# Use non-privileged user to run the app.
# www-data usually already exists in the system but could be any other user as well.
# Make sure this user has read access to application files and, if using
# config file at $NODE_CONFIG_PATH, then to this file as well
User=www-data
Group=www-data

# --- Execution ---

# npm location is dependent on platform.
# Use `which npm` to resolve actual path.
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start

# Alternatively you can use `npx` instead of `npm`. This way you would not have to
# manage application files or dependencies manually. For upgrading, just modify
# application version in the following command and run `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart postal-dns`
# NB! First start after version change is going to take some time as `npx` has to install all dependencies.
#ExecStart=/usr/bin/npx postal-dns@1.2.14

Type=simple
Restart=always
